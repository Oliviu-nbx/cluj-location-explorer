# Cluj Compass - Development Roadmap

## Current Status

The Cluj Compass application is currently in development with the following components implemented:

- Basic UI structure and components
- In-memory location data management
- Admin panel interface
- Authentication structure
- Supabase integration foundation

## Immediate Priority Tasks

These tasks should be addressed first to establish core functionality:

1. **Database Implementation**
   - [ ] Create all required tables in Supabase
   - [ ] Implement RLS policies for data security
   - [ ] Migrate sample data to actual database

2. **Authentication Completion**
   - [ ] Complete user registration and login flow
   - [ ] Implement admin role verification
   - [ ] Add profile management

3. **LocationService Refactoring**
   - [ ] Split into smaller service files by domain
   - [ ] Replace sample data with actual Supabase queries
   - [ ] Implement proper error handling

4. **Admin Panel Completion**
   - [ ] Complete location management functionality
   - [ ] Implement image upload for locations
   - [ ] Finalize category management

## Medium Priority Tasks

These tasks enhance the application but aren't critical for basic functionality:

1. **External API Integration**
   - [ ] Complete Google Places API integration
   - [ ] Implement TripAdvisor data scraping
   - [ ] Add Booking.com integration for hotel data

2. **User Features**
   - [ ] Implement favorites functionality
   - [ ] Add user reviews system
   - [ ] Create personalized recommendations

3. **Search & Discovery**
   - [ ] Implement advanced search with filters
   - [ ] Add geolocation-based nearby search
   - [ ] Create category-based browsing experience

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - [ ] Implement server-side pagination
   - [ ] Optimize image loading and caching
   - [ ] Add query result caching with Supabase

## Future Enhancements

These are longer-term goals for the application:

1. **Mobile Application**
   - [ ] Create React Native version
   - [ ] Implement offline support
   - [ ] Add push notifications

2. **Social Features**
   - [ ] User-generated content (photos, tips)
   - [ ] Social sharing integration
   - [ ] User following system

3. **Premium Features**
   - [ ] Booking integration for hotels and restaurants
   - [ ] Subscription model for premium content
   - [ ] Business owner verification and management

4. **Analytics & Insights**
   - [ ] Enhanced analytics dashboard
   - [ ] User behavior tracking
   - [ ] Conversion optimization tools

## Technical Debt Items

Issues that should be addressed to improve code quality and maintainability:

1. **Code Refactoring**
   - [ ] Split large components into smaller ones
   - [ ] Create dedicated hooks for common functionality
   - [ ] Improve type definitions and interfaces

2. **Testing Implementation**
   - [ ] Add unit tests for core services
   - [ ] Implement component tests
   - [ ] Add end-to-end tests for critical flows

3. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Add JSDoc comments to all functions
   - [ ] Create component usage examples
   - [ ] Document API endpoints and data structures

4. **Build Process**
   - [ ] Optimize bundle size
   - [ ] Implement code splitting
   - [ ] Add performance monitoring

## Deployment Strategy

1. **Development Environment**
   - Supabase development project
   - Local development server
   - Feature branch deployments

2. **Staging Environment**
   - Separate Supabase staging project
   - Pre-production verification
   - Integration testing

3. **Production Environment**
   - Production Supabase project
   - CDN integration
   - Monitoring and alerting

## Resource Requirements

1. **Development**
   - Frontend developer (React, TypeScript)
   - Backend developer (Supabase, SQL)
   - UI/UX designer

2. **APIs & Services**
   - Google Places API (location data)
   - Mapbox or Google Maps (maps)
   - Image optimization service

3. **Infrastructure**
   - Supabase (database, auth, storage)
   - Vercel/Netlify (frontend hosting)
   - Monitoring service (Sentry, LogRocket)

## Success Metrics

1. **User Engagement**
   - Number of active users
   - Time spent in application
   - Return visit rate

2. **Content Growth**
   - Number of locations
   - User-generated reviews
   - Location ratings and completeness

3. **Technical Performance**
   - Page load times
   - API response times
   - Error rates

---

This roadmap provides a structured approach to completing and enhancing the Cluj Compass application. Priority should be given to database implementation and authentication to establish a solid foundation before moving on to more advanced features.
